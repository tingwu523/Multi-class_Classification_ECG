# Multi-class_Classification_ECG
Developed models of three dimensional datasets using Python extension libraries such as pandas, numpy, wfdb, and ast, and used machine learning libraries such as scikit- learn and TensorFlow to analyze the model.

Trained the data models by machine learning and compared with linear multi-class classification, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in machine learning to compare the accuracy between the models.

The dataset is from: https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.3/
