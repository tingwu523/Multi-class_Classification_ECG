# Multi-class_Classification_ECG
In this project we aim to create and train a model using PTB-XL dataset, which contains ECG classified into five categories: Normal ECG, Myocardial Infarction, ST/T Change, Conduction Disturbance and Hypertrophy. We initially plan to implement linear multi-class classification on it. However, as we dig deeper, this work appears to be much more complicated than we thought. After implementing complex models like Convolutional Neural
Networks(CNN) and combination of CNN and LSTM, the accuracy rate always fails to exceed 60%. So this is a failure analysis report, which could provide us some experience for future study in machine learning.

The dataset is from: https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.3/
